TIL is an initialism commonly used on the internet, meaning "Today I Learned".  I usually find myself learning something new whenever I stumble across these little nuggets of wisdom.

To see them more often, I built a Twitter bot, [@welearnedtoday](https://twitter.com/welearnedtoday) that retweets TIL tweets seen in the wild.

I hope it helps you learn something new today.
