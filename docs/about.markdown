I'm Jeffery Bennett & I'm honored that you’ve stopped by.

I'm a technologist living in Minnetonka, Minnesota with my pretty wife & [three](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIJ8MFnd2p/) [genius](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_YlUGzHore/) [children](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ch5iO_sJu0R/).

Prior to Minnesota, I did some time in San Francisco, a bit in Boston, got a design degree at the University of Cincinnati and grew up in Niles, Ohio.

I'm fond of building stuff out of cardboard, 80’s pop culture, making ephemeral buttons & homemade Halloween costumes.

## Experience

I’ve been lucky enough to have the opportunity to work with amazing teams at Apple, Sundance, Target, TechCrunch and many more.

I'm now working at the job of my dreams at Nvidia, helping cars (and not cars) work without humans.
