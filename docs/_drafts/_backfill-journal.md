## Idea

What if I could write about a memory I had, say, my first unchaperoned concert.  I would include the people that went with me & my recollection of the event.  This would get appended into my life record and the life records of the people I mentioned.

## Augmentation

Because my first concert was part of the public record, the application could assist in setting the start / end times of the event.

## Start by defining bigger details to help contextualize the smaller ones.

Initial prompts from the system could begin as broad as:

"Where have you lived? From what times?"

Once you've got that defined, you've done a couple of cool things:

Created a frame for future questions.

Also started to define the broad events / context timeframe for friends & family (people who were near you at those times)

## Take advantage of public data to enrich journal entries.

Having public temporal data helps frame questions to better create recall.

"When you were living in Cincinnati, Ohio in 2000, what did you do on your 24th birthday.  The weather was 81 degrees.  You were in your 3rd year at the University of Cincinnati.  You were living with Kyle, Paul, Ryan and Kara." 

## Colliding memories

The more you include others in your memories, the more you'll find that your recollection isn't as accurate as you thought.  This will necessitate the need to have multiple, different, records for the same event.
